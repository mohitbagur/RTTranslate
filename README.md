# RTTranslate

Description:

This Python project utilizes various libraries to create a Speech-to-Translation converter. The script employs the SpeechRecognition library for audio input, Google's Speech Recognition service for speech recognition, the Translator library for language translation, gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for generating audio from translated text, and the playsound library for playing the generated audio.

The `recognize_and_translate` function captures spoken words through a microphone, recognizes the speech using Google Speech Recognition, translates it into a specified target language, and prints both the original and translated text. The `play_translation` function takes the translated text, converts it to an MP3 audio file, and plays the audio file.

The `main` function orchestrates the continuous operation of the converter by repeatedly invoking the recognition and translation functions, providing a real-time experience for users. This project serves as a practical example of integrating various Python libraries to create a simple yet effective speech-to-translation application.

Feel free to use and modify this script for your language translation needs. For more details and usage instructions, refer to the project's documentation.
